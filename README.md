## Important: this repository is now deprecated in favor of MoonchildProductions/UXP

In time, issues will be duplicated to the new working repository which is a
re-forking of Mozilla code at an earlier fork point to avoid breaking issues
with the current code making it unsuitable for platform development.

# Unified XUL Platform (UXP-deprecated)
## Codename: MÃ¶bius

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an early-2017 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a future platform to be used by XUL
applications.

This repository will contain at least one application to demonstrate and make use
of the platform: The Basilisk web browser, a close twin to Mozilla's Firefox.

If you fork this repository to perform your own work on it, please consider

platform and build a future for XUL.
